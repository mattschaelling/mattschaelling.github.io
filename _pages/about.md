I am a 4th-year graduate student in the [Department of Economics at Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu) with interests in applied microeconomics. My research spans topics in urban economics and the economics of education. My active projects are examining the effects of land use regulations on both market-rate and subsidized housing in the US, identifying the role of sewer infrastructure in explaining urban outcomes across middle-income countries, and understanding bias in standardized testing.

I am affiliated with the [Population Studies and Training Center](https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/) and [Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4)](https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/) at Brown University. Prior to graduate school, I was a predoctoral research fellow at [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR)](https://siepr.stanford.edu), mentored by [Susan Athey](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/), and completed a B.S. in applied and computational mathematics at [Brigham Young University](https://acme.byu.edu).
