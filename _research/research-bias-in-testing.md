title: "Content Relatability and Test Score Disparities: Evidence from Texas"

excerpt: 'One goal of standardized tests is to measure aptitude across heterogeneous students with minimal bias. However, students differ in their experiential knowledge, familiarity, or interest in topics that appear in written content. Could this contribute to bias and widen observed racial test gaps? We study this question empirically using item-level data from high-stakes reading comprehension exams in Texas. We use detailed time-use data and natural language processing techniques to define and build a race/ethnicity-specific measure of a student's ``relatability'' to passage content in the exams. Relying on quasi-random variation in topics across passages, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the presence of relatable text in a passage predicts a 1.7pp increase in performance on the passage. Extended to the test-level, a one standard deviation increase in test-level relatability leads to a 0.05 standard deviation change in student performance. Our results suggest that equalizing the relatability of passages in these standardized tests could reduce the Black-white and Hispanic-white test score gaps by 4\% (0.5pp and 0.4pp, respectively). We then counterfactually estimate over 11,000 Black students and 15,000 Hispanic students during our sample period were designated to be at a lower reading comprehension level due to relatability.'
